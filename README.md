# Hi, I'm Bianca ðŸ˜Š # 

## About me ##
A passionate junior front-end developer with back-end knowledge. I enjoy working in collaborative and innovative teams where I can continue learning and growing. I am creative and naturally curious. I love English and incorporate it into many aspects of my life. I am a committed and dedicated person to my work and highly value quality. Additionally, I have cultivated serenity and patience because experience has taught me that progress is achieved step by step. I am constantly seeking to improve myself and contribute in a meaningful way to every project I undertake.

I also have a big passion for design and I find programming a great way to combine both the logical, problem-solving, researching part of the brain with the left hemisphere that is more about creativity, imagination and innovation.  
 
I'm so keen to keep diving into the IT world and gain more and more knowledge.
