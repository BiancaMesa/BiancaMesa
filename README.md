# Hi, I'm Bianca # 

## About me ðŸ’« ##
A passionate junior front-end developer with back-end knowledge. I enjoy working in collaborative and innovative teams where I can continue learning and growing. I am creative and naturally curious. I love English and incorporate it into many aspects of my life. I am dedicated and bring quality to my work. Additionally, I have cultivated serenity and patience because experience has taught me that progress is achieved step by step. I am constantly seeking to improve myself and contribute to every project I undertake in a meaningful way.

I have a big passion for design and I find programming a great way to combine both the logical, problem-solving part of the brain with the left hemisphere that is more about creativity, imagination and innovation.
